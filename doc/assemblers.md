# Assemblers

List of assemblers which might be useful for serratus.

Please update this list if you have ideas, corrections, comments. If you don't have commit rights to this repository, add a comment to Issue #71 or send me an email (robert@drive5.com). For each assembler, provide:

1. Name
2. Type (e.g. reference or de-novo)
3. Link to code
4. Link to paper
5. Comments on pros or cons for the serratus project.

Use "??" as a placeholder if not known.

**Kollector**  
Type: Targetted De-novo  
Code: https://github.com/bcgsc/kollector  
Paper: doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx078  
Comments: Orignally tested for genomic DNA assembly, may need refinement to work with transcriptome data.  

**ABySS**  
Type: De-novo Genomic  
Code: https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss  
Paper: doi: 10.1101/gr.214346.116  
Comments: ??  

**RNA-Bloom**  
Type: De-novo Transcriptomic  
Code: https://github.com/bcgsc/RNA-Bloom  
Paper: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/701607  
Comments: Isoform assembly maybe an unnecessary feature, but our datasets are expected to be transciptomic.
